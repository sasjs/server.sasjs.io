## Do I need a server?

No!  You can run SASjs Server on your laptop or computer - so long as you have a local instance of SAS.

## Will this work on SAS Viya?

Yes - you can point to the sas.sh in the SPRE folder

## Will this work on SAS EBI?

Yes - just point to the sas executable in the SASHOME folder

## Will this work with SAS University Edition

No.  If you are running University Edition, or the free / online learning instance, you cannot use SASjs.  This is because there is no connectivity outside of these environments.
