# Apps

The apps portal is a gateway to any apps that you have deployed to SASjs Server.

## Creating Apps

Anybody can create an app for SASjs Server - it just needs to be compiled using the [SASjs CLI](https://cli.sasjs.io/compile).  The output of this process is a zip file that can be imported to any SASjs Server instance.

## Deploying Apps

Simply click the "Upload New App" button and select the local zip file containing the app you wish to deploy.

Alternative deployment approaches include:

* `sasjs deploy` - [https://cli.sasjs.io/deploy/](https://cli.sasjs.io/deploy/)
* Use the `/SASjsApi/drive/deploy/upload` API
* Use the `/SASjsApi/drive/deploy` API

## Available Apps

SASjs Server does NOT contain an in-built "app store", however you may download apps from the following locations and upload them to your SASjs Server instance.

### Data Controller for SASÂ®

[Data Controller](https://datacontroller.io) is a full-blown SAS application to provide business users with a carefully-controlled capability to make changes to data in SAS.
