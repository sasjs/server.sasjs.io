# SASjs Server Documentation

SASjs Server provides a visual interface and REST API for executing programs directly against the SAS executable (`sas.exe`/`sas.sh`).  The executable could be on a desktop, or an actual SAS server.  It works in a broadly similar way to the SASÂ® Stored Process server, or the Viya Job Execution Service - if you have either of these, then it is likely you do not need SASjs Server.

SASjs Server is FAST - responsiveness (for SAS Stored Programs) is around 200 milliseconds.  The following features are provided out of the box:

* SASjs Studio - for running SAS code and examining webout content
* REST API - documentation which can also used to make actual API calls
* AppStream - a portal for home-grown or third-party SAS-Powered Web Applications

If you are running older versions of SAS, or SAS on a desktop, then this product will enable you to:

* Install third party apps (such as [Data Controller for SAS](https://datacontroller.io))
* Run [tests](https://cli.sasjs.io/test) on your SAS Jobs, Services and Macros 
* Execute SAS code from a browser
* Execute JS code from SAS
* Build applications on SAS 

SASjs Server is MIT open source and the repository is available here:  [https://github.com/sasjs/server](https://github.com/sasjs/server).
