# SASjs Server Documentation

SASjs Server provides an interface for the storage and execution of jobs against a SAS executable.  The executable could be on a desktop, or an actual SAS Server.  It works in a similar way to the SASÂ® Stored Process server, or the Viya Job Execution server - if you have either of these, then you likely do not need SASjs Server.

If you are running older versions of SAS, or SAS on a desktop, then this product is likely to be interesting if you would like to be able to:

* Create HTML5 apps (and have them easily migrate to SAS 9 or Viya)
* Prepare for a future SAS 9 or Viya migration
* Execute SAS code from a browser, from your own or a remote machine

SASjs Server is MIT open source and the repository is available here:  [https://github.com/sasjs/server](https://github.com/sasjs/server).
