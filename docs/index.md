# SASjs Server Documentation

SASjs Server provides a visual interface and rest API for executing programs directly against the SAS executable (`sas.exe`/`sas.sh`).  The executable could be on a desktop, or an actual server.  It works in a broadly similar way to the SASÂ® Stored Process server, or the Viya Job Execution Service - if you have either of these, then you likely do not need SASjs Server.

If you are running older versions of SAS, or SAS on a desktop, then this product will enable you to:

* Build applications on SAS and have them easily migrate to SAS 9 or Viya
* Prepare for a future SAS 9 or Viya migration
* Execute SAS code from a browser, from your own or a remote machine

SASjs Server is MIT open source and the repository is available here:  [https://github.com/sasjs/server](https://github.com/sasjs/server).
