# SASjs Studio

The big difference between SASjs Studio and other SAS executors is that every execution is with a CLEAN session.

Other than that, everything works as you would expect.  The log is sent to the log window, and the WEBOUT page contains any content sent to the _webout fileref.

It is [possible to ctrl-click](https://github.com/sasjs/server/issues/119#issuecomment-1100668248) to run code, or to highlight and select the running man icon.

Code is saved in local storage, so you don't lose your work if you close the browser tab.
